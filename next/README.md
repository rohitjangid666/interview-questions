## What is Next.js?

- Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications.
- It provides a set of features and optimizations for building production-ready web applications.
- Next.js simplifies the development process by offering built-in routing, code splitting, and performance optimizations.

## Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server for better SEO and performance.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for faster load times.
- **API Routes**: Allows building API endpoints within the application.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images for faster loading.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Built-in support for multiple languages and locales.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Loads only the necessary JavaScript for each page.
- **File-Based Routing**: Simplifies routing by using the file system to define routes.

## What is the difference between Next.js and React?

- **Rendering**: Next.js supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), while React is primarily a client-side library.
- **Routing**: Next.js has a built-in file-based routing system, whereas React requires additional libraries like React Router for routing.
- **Performance**: Next.js includes optimizations like automatic code splitting and image optimization, which are not available in React by default.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints directly within the application, while React does not have this feature.

## Types of Rendering in Next.js

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, generating static HTML files that can be served quickly. It is `excellent for SEO and performance`, as the content is pre-rendered and cached, `reducing server load`.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server for each request, providing dynamic content based on user requests. SSR `enhances SEO` and provides `faster initial load` times but can `increase server load`.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Renders pages on the client side using JavaScript, similar to traditional React applications. CSR can result in `slower initial page loads` and potential `SEO issues`.

## How does Next.js handle routing?

- Next.js uses a file-based routing system where each file in the `pages` directory corresponds to a route.
- For example, a file named `pages/about.js` will be accessible at the `/about` route.
- Dynamic routes can be created using square brackets, such as `pages/posts/[id].js`, which will match any URL like `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, etc.
- Next.js also supports nested routes by creating subdirectories within the `pages` directory.

## Routing in Next.js using `pages` or `app` directory

- In Next.js, routing can be handled using either the `pages` directory or the `app` directory.
- `pages` directory:

  - The `pages` directory is the traditional way of defining routes in Next.js.
  - Each file in the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route, e.g., `pages/index.js` corresponds to the root route `/`, and `pages/about.js` corresponds to `/about`.
  - Dynamic routes can be created using square brackets, e.g., `pages/posts/[id].js`.
  - The `pages` directory supports both static and server-side rendering.
  - The `pages` directory is suitable for most applications and is the default routing method in Next.js.
  - It allows for easy organization of routes and components.
  - It is the recommended approach for most use cases, especially for smaller applications.
  - `Layout` components can be used to share common layouts across different pages.

    - Example:

      ```jsx
      // pages/_app.js
      import Layout from '../components/Layout';

      function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
        return (
          <Layout>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </Layout>
        );
      }

      export default MyApp;
      ```

  - Per-page layouts can also be implemented by creating a `Layout` component for each page.

    - Example:

      ```jsx
      // pages/about.js
      import AboutLayout from '../components/AboutLayout';

      function AboutPage() {
        return <div>About Page Content</div>;
      }

      AboutPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {
        return <AboutLayout>{page}</AboutLayout>;
      };

      export default AboutPage;

      // pages/_app.js
      function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
        const getLayout = Component.getLayout || ((page) => page);
        return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />);
      }
      export default MyApp;
      ```
